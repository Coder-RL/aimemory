# Security Policy

## Overview

The Cross-Platform AI Memory Bank extension is built with security as a fundamental principle. This document outlines our security practices, vulnerability reporting procedures, and the measures we've implemented to protect users and their data.

## Security Principles

### 1. Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of security controls
- Input validation at every boundary
- Principle of least privilege
- Fail-safe defaults

### 2. Zero Trust Architecture
- Validate all inputs regardless of source
- Authenticate and authorize all operations
- Encrypt data in transit and at rest
- Monitor and audit all activities

### 3. Privacy by Design
- Minimal data collection
- Local data processing
- No external data transmission
- User control over all data

## Security Features

### Input Validation and Sanitization

#### Content Validation
```typescript
// All user content is validated and sanitized
const validation = InputValidator.validateMemoryBankContent(content);
if (!validation.isValid) {
    throw new SecurityError('Content validation failed');
}
```

**Protected Against**:
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks
- Script injection
- Malicious HTML content
- Dangerous URL schemes

#### Path Validation
```typescript
// All file paths are validated to prevent traversal attacks
const pathValidation = InputValidator.validateFilePath(path, basePath);
if (!pathValidation.isValid) {
    throw new SecurityError('Invalid file path');
}
```

**Protected Against**:
- Directory traversal attacks
- Unauthorized file access
- Path injection
- Null byte attacks

### Access Control

#### Workspace Boundaries
- All file operations are restricted to the workspace directory
- No access to system files or directories outside the workspace
- Configurable allowed paths for additional security

#### Permission Checks
```typescript
// Every file operation is authorized
await accessControl.authorizeFileOperation('write', filePath, content);
```

**Controls**:
- Read/write/delete permissions
- File type restrictions
- Size limitations
- Path restrictions

### Network Security

#### Local-Only Server
- MCP server binds only to localhost (127.0.0.1)
- No external network access
- Configurable port with validation

#### CORS Protection
```typescript
// Strict CORS policy
app.use(cors({
    origin: ['http://localhost:5173', 'http://localhost:3000'],
    credentials: true
}));
```

#### Request Validation
- All HTTP requests are validated
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Request size limits
- Content-Type validation

### Data Protection

#### Encryption
- All sensitive data is encrypted at rest
- Secure transport protocols (HTTPS when applicable)
- Cryptographic checksums for data integrity

#### Data Minimization
- Only necessary data is collected and stored
- No telemetry or analytics without explicit consent
- Local processing only - no cloud dependencies

## Security Audit

### Built-in Security Auditing

The extension includes comprehensive security auditing:

```bash
# Run security audit
Command Palette > "Memory Bank: Validate Integrity"
```

#### Audit Categories
1. **Input Validation**: Tests for XSS, injection, and malformed input
2. **Access Control**: Verifies path restrictions and permissions
3. **Data Integrity**: Checks checksums and file consistency
4. **Configuration**: Validates security settings
5. **Network**: Tests for secure communication

#### Audit Results
- **Security Score**: 0-100 based on findings
- **Findings**: Detailed security issues with severity levels
- **Recommendations**: Actionable security improvements

### External Security Testing

#### Penetration Testing
- Regular security assessments by third-party experts
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Code security reviews

#### Dependency Scanning
```bash
# Check for vulnerable dependencies
npm audit

# Fix vulnerabilities
npm audit fix
```

## Vulnerability Reporting

### Reporting Security Issues

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

#### Preferred Method: Security Advisory
1. Go to [Security Advisories](https://github.com/Coder-RL/aimemory/security/advisories)
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability

#### Alternative Method: Email
Send details to: security@aimemory.dev

#### Information to Include
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)
- Your contact information

### Response Timeline

| Timeframe | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| 24 hours | Initial acknowledgment |
| 72 hours | Initial assessment and triage |
| 7 days | Detailed analysis and response plan |
| 30 days | Fix development and testing |
| 45 days | Release and public disclosure |

### Severity Classification

#### Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0)
- Remote code execution
- Privilege escalation
- Data exfiltration

#### High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)
- Authentication bypass
- Significant data exposure
- Denial of service

#### Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)
- Information disclosure
- Limited privilege escalation
- Cross-site scripting

#### Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)
- Minor information leaks
- Low-impact denial of service
- Configuration issues

## Security Best Practices
