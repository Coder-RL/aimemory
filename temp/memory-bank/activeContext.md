# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The project is currently in the initial setup and development phase. The main focus is on:

1. Setting up the Memory Bank structure to maintain project context
2. Establishing the foundational React application structure
3. Preparing for Figma API integration to fetch design assets

## Recent Changes
- Created the basic React + TypeScript + Vite application structure
- Set up the essential project files (.env, configuration files)
- Added food imagery assets in the public directory
- Implemented a basic landing page layout with:
  - Hero section with background image
  - Food image gallery
  - Feature cards highlighting USPs (farm-to-table, organic, etc.)
  - Call-to-action button
- Added Figma access token in the .env file

## Next Steps
1. **Figma API Integration**:
   - Implement service functions to fetch design data from Figma
   - Set up proper error handling for API calls
   - Create components to display Figma design elements

2. **Component Refactoring**:
   - Extract feature cards into a separate component
   - Create a reusable food gallery component
   - Implement proper component hierarchy

3. **Responsive Enhancements**:
   - Ensure proper mobile and tablet layouts
   - Optimize images for different screen sizes
   - Implement responsive navigation

4. **Interactivity**:
   - Add functionality to the "Explore the menu" button
   - Implement image zooming/preview for food items
   - Add transitions and animations for better UX

5. **Testing and Optimization**:
   - Set up a testing framework (Jest, Testing Library)
   - Implement component tests
   - Optimize performance and load times

## Active Decisions and Considerations
1. **Component Structure**: Deciding on the optimal component structure as the app grows. Currently considering extracting feature cards and food gallery into separate components.

2. **Figma Integration Approach**: Evaluating whether to use direct API calls or a dedicated Figma integration library. The decision will impact maintenance and flexibility.

3. **Styling Strategy**: Considering whether to continue with standard CSS or adopt a CSS-in-JS solution like styled-components or emotion for better component encapsulation.

4. **State Management**: Assessing if local component state will remain sufficient or if a more robust state management solution will be needed as the application grows.

5. **Performance Optimization**: Planning strategies for optimizing image loading and overall application performance, especially for the food image gallery.
