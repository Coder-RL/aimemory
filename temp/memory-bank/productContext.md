# Product Context

## Purpose and Problem Statement
This project aims to bridge the gap between design and development by showcasing an integrated workflow between Figma (design) and Cursor IDE (development). The application addresses the following problems:

1. Disconnect between design assets in Figma and their implementation in code
2. Need for a visually appealing demonstration of farm-to-table food concepts
3. Requirement for a modern, responsive web application that follows current best practices

## User Experience Goals
The application prioritizes the following user experience elements:

- **Visual Impact**: A strong emphasis on high-quality food imagery to create immediate visual appeal
- **Simplicity**: Clean, uncluttered interface with intuitive navigation
- **Clarity**: Clear messaging about the farm-to-table, organic nature of the food
- **Responsiveness**: Seamless experience across different device sizes
- **Exploration**: Easy ways to discover and engage with menu options

## Workflow and Functionality
1. **Landing Experience**: Users are greeted with a visually striking background image and clear value proposition
2. **Food Showcase**: A gallery-style presentation of food imagery highlights quality and variety
3. **Key Features**: Clear callouts for differentiating features (farm-to-table, organic, grass-fed)
4. **Call to Action**: Prominent "Explore the menu" button to drive user engagement
5. **Figma Integration**: Behind the scenes, the application pulls design elements and potentially updates from Figma using the API

## Key Value Propositions
The application emphasizes three core values to users:
1. **Farm to Table**: Emphasizing freshness and local sourcing
2. **Quality Ingredients**: 100% grass-fed beef highlighting premium quality
3. **Health and Sustainability**: 100% organic and natural ingredients focus on health-conscious customers

## Intended Outcomes
- Users gain an appreciation for the visual quality and values of the food offerings
- Developers can see an example of Figma integration with React/TypeScript
- The application serves as a foundation for potential expansion into a full restaurant website with ordering capabilities
