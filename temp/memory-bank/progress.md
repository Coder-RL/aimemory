# Progress

## What Works
- âœ… Basic React + TypeScript + Vite application setup
- âœ… Project configuration (TypeScript, ESLint, etc.)
- âœ… Basic landing page UI structure:
  - Hero section with background image
  - Food image gallery
  - Feature cards (farm-to-table, organic, etc.)
  - Call-to-action button
- âœ… Static assets integration (food images)
- âœ… Environment variable setup for Figma API token

## What's in Progress
- ðŸ”„ Memory Bank setup and documentation
- ðŸ”„ Planning for component architecture refinement
- ðŸ”„ Research on optimal Figma API integration approach

## What's Left to Build
- ðŸ”² Figma API integration service
- ðŸ”² Component refactoring and organization
- ðŸ”² Responsive design implementation
- ðŸ”² Enhanced interactivity and user experience
- ðŸ”² Menu exploration functionality
- ðŸ”² Animations and transitions
- ðŸ”² Testing framework setup and tests
- ðŸ”² Performance optimization
- ðŸ”² Deployment setup

## Current Status
The project is in its **initial development phase**. The basic structure is in place with a functioning landing page that showcases the visual concept. The next major development step is implementing the Figma API integration to enhance the connection between design and code.

### Blockers
- None currently identified

### Priorities
1. Complete the Memory Bank setup for better project documentation
2. Implement Figma API integration
3. Refactor components for better maintainability
4. Enhance responsive design
5. Add interactive elements

## Known Issues
- No automated tests have been implemented yet
- Component structure is not yet optimized for scalability
- Responsive design may need improvements for various screen sizes
- No error handling for potential Figma API issues

## Recent Achievements
- Successfully set up the project with modern React (version 19)
- Implemented a visually appealing landing page
- Created a clean project structure following best practices
