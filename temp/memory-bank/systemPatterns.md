# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview
The application follows a standard React Single Page Application (SPA) architecture built with TypeScript and Vite as the build tool. The system is organized according to the following architectural patterns:

```
cursor-figma-mcp/
├── public/             # Static assets including images
├── src/
│   ├── assets/         # Additional assets used in the application
│   ├── components/     # React components (to be organized as the app grows)
│   ├── App.tsx         # Main application component
│   ├── App.css         # Main application styles
│   ├── main.tsx        # Application entry point
│   └── index.css       # Global styles
└── .env                # Environment variables including Figma API token
```

## Key Design Patterns
1. **Component-Based Architecture**: UI is broken down into reusable React components
2. **Functional Components**: Modern React functional components with hooks are used instead of class components
3. **Declarative UI**: React's declarative approach to building UI is leveraged for maintainability
4. **CSS-in-JS**: Styles are managed together with their components for better encapsulation
5. **Environmental Configuration**: External services like Figma are configured via environment variables

## Component Relationships
Currently, the app has a simple component structure with:
- App.tsx as the main container component
- Feature cards for highlighting key product features
- Image gallery for showcasing food options
- In the future, we may extract these into separate component files as complexity grows

## State Management
For the current scope, local component state is sufficient. No complex state management library is required yet. As the application grows, we may consider:
- Context API for simpler shared state
- Redux or similar if more complex state management becomes necessary

## API Integration
Figma API integration follows these patterns:
1. Access token stored in environment variables (.env file)
2. API calls abstracted into service functions (to be implemented)
3. Async/await pattern for handling API responses
4. Error handling with appropriate user feedback

## Styling Approach
The application uses standard CSS with a focus on:
1. Responsive design principles
2. Flexbox layout
3. Modern CSS features
4. Consistent color palette and typography

## Future Architectural Considerations
1. Component library extraction as UI elements grow
2. More robust routing if additional pages are needed
3. API service layer abstraction
4. Testing strategy implementation
5. Potential server-side rendering for SEO if needed
